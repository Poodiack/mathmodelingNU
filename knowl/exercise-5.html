<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Now we're going to write a subroutine that is suitable for a company that builds custom display aquariums for use in dentist's offices and other upscale businesses. Customers come with orders and the cost must be correctly calculated, based on the sizes of the six panels which comprise the rectangular aquarium.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">It turns out that the particular materials that the company is using have the following costs:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The bottom of the aquarium is metal, and costs 1.3 cents/sq in.</li>
<li>The top of the aquarium is plastic, and costs half a cent/sq in.</li>
<li>The sides of the aquarium are glass, and cost 5 cents/sq in.</li>
</ul>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Given a customer preference for the volume of the aquarium, there are many choices of dimensions and they will have substantially different costs. Consider a customer who wants a 12,000 cubic inch aquarium. (Note that 12,000 cubic inches is about 52 gallons so that is not a very large aquarium at all.) We can compute the following prices:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>A choice of \(20\times 30\times 20\) has a cost of $110.80.</li>
<li>A choice of \(40\times 30\times 10\) has a cost of $91.60.</li>
<li>A choice of \(60\times 20\times 10\) has a cost of $101.60.</li>
<li>A choice of \(80\times 15\times 10\) has a cost of $116.60.</li>
</ul>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Those prices were computed using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">analyzeAquariumDesign</code> subroutine, which is found below. The commands calling the subroutine are found below the code.</p>

    Here the dimensions of an aquarium are the inputs. The
    sizes of the six panels that form the rectangular aquarium
    will be printed on the screen, along with their costs. The
    costs are computed in terms of the areas of those panels and 
    the global variables top_cost, bottom_cost, and side_cost.
    Finally, the volume and the total cost are displayed.

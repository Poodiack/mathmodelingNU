<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Define variables and parameters.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><em class="emphasis">Variables</em> are quantities that could change within a problem. <em class="emphasis">Parameters</em> are quantities that are constant within a problem, but that could change between problems of the same type. The first part on this step is to determine what variables and parameters are involved. This may be simple and obvious, or very complicated. Often times there are potentially hundreds of quantities involved. To make the model manageable, we need to make assumptions as to which are the most important and which can be ignored. At a later time we could add additional variables and parameters to refine the model.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In this example, variables include:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Time</li>
<li>Population</li>
<li>Temperature</li>
<li>Amount of food present</li>
<li>Amount of available space in the dish</li>
</ol>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">These are all values that change as the population grows. Since the initial observation did not give any information on temperature, food, or space, we will ignore these variables and focus on only time and population.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Possible parameters to consider include:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>The initial population</li>
<li>Growth rate (we will assume this is constant)</li>
<li>Size of the dish</li>
<li>Initial amount of food</li>
</ol>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">These are all values that are constant once we put the bacteria in the dish and allow them to grow. But if we consider a different dish with a different population of bacteria, they could change. Again, since we don’t know anything about the size of the dish or the amount of food, we will ignore these parameters.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The second part of this step is to choose symbols to represent the variables and parameters. For this example, let</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
n &amp; = \text{time in days from the present }(n = 0, 1,\dots) \\
r &amp; = \text{the growth rate (in decimal form)} \\
a_n &amp; = \text{the population at the beginning of day }n \\
a_0 &amp; = \text{the initial population}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

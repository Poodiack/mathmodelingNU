<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Select the modeling approach.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In this step we determine the form of the model. In some situations this is easy to do; in others we may have several reasonable choices. Making the right choice requires at least some knowledge of all the possibilities. It also depends on the nature of the assumptions being made.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Often times this step begins with some simple observations. Note that we started with 500 bacteria. After 1 day, it increased by 25, which is 5% of 500. After a second day it increased by 26, which is approximately 5% of 525. The growth rate (or change per day) appears to be relatively constant. This suggests a simple relationship between the populations on consecutive days:</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\text{Population on one day}=\text{Population on previous day } + 5\%
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This relationship indicates that we may be able to derive a simple equation to model the population.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="process.html#li-19">in-context</a></span>

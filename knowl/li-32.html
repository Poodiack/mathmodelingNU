<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Solve the model and state the solution.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Here we use the term “solve” loosely. Solving a model may involve solving a single equation, as in this example, it may involve constructing a graph and qualitatively describing its behavior, or it may involve running a simulation several hundred times and summarizing the resulting data. The meaning of the term solve is relative to the type of model.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In this example, the question is “when will the population be 600?” In terms of our variables, this can be stated as “find \(n\) such that \(a_n = 600\text{.}\)” This yields the equation</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
600 = (1+0.05)^n\cdot 500
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Solving this equation using logarithms yields \(n\approx 3.7\text{.}\) This means that at the beginning of the fourth day we will have over 600 bacteria. This is our solution.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Often times the results of a model are used to guide decisions. In many practical situations, such as in business or the military, the person doing the modeling is not the final decision maker. The final decision maker is a CEO or officer who is not a mathematician. Therefore, the solution should be stated in as non-technical language as reasonably possible.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="process.html#li-32">in-context</a></span>

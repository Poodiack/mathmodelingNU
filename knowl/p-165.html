<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><em class="emphasis">Variables</em> are quantities that could change within a problem. <em class="emphasis">Parameters</em> are quantities that are constant within a problem, but that could change between problems of the same type. The first part on this step is to determine what variables and parameters are involved. This may be simple and obvious, or very complicated. Often times there are potentially hundreds of quantities involved. To make the model manageable, we need to make assumptions as to which are the most important and which can be ignored. At a later time we could add additional variables and parameters to refine the model.</p>

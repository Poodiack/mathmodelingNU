<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Obviously there are many factors involved with life expectancy; the number of persons per physician is only one of them. It seems reasonable to believe that as the number of persons per physician increases (meaning fewer doctors per person), life expectancy decreases because people would not have as easy access to health care.  We do not claim that the number of people per physician <em class="emphasis">causes</em> life expectancy, but there is a relationship between the two variables. It is not at all clear how the variables of people per physician and life expectancy are related theoretically, so we will not even attempt to construct an analytical model. We will construct an empirical model by fitting various linearizable models to this data and analyzing how well each one fits.</p>
